# Git Autopilot

Autopilot: a CLI that watches your project, commits, and pushes automatically — zero Git hassle.

Autopilot is a lightweight, developer-friendly CLI tool that automates Git initialization, commits, and pushes.
It lets developers instantly turn any local folder into a live GitHub repository — handling setup, authentication, and auto-pushing file changes behind the scenes.

Designed for simplicity, Autopilot is ideal for developers who frequently create small experiments, side projects, or micro-repos and want Git/GitHub setup to be completely hands-off.

## Usage
```bash
autopilot --help
autopilot --version
```
