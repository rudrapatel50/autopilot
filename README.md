# Git Autopilot

Autopilot: a CLI that watches your project, commits, and pushes automatically â€” zero Git hassle.

Autopilot is a lightweight, developer-friendly CLI tool that automates Git initialization, commits, and pushes.
It lets developers instantly turn any local folder into a live GitHub repository â€” handling setup, authentication, and auto-pushing file changes behind the scenes.

Designed for simplicity, Autopilot is ideal for developers who frequently create small experiments, side projects, or micro-repos and want Git/GitHub setup to be completely hands-off.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @git/autopilot
```

## Features

âœ… **Connect to GitHub** - Securely store your GitHub Personal Access Token  
âœ… **Check Connection** - Verify your current GitHub connection status  
âœ… **Logout** - Disconnect and remove stored credentials  
ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Commits** - Smart commit messages generated by AI (coming soon)  
ðŸš§ **Auto-commit & Push** - Automatically commit and push changes (coming soon)  
ðŸš§ **Watch Mode** - Monitor file changes and auto-push (coming soon)  
ðŸš§ **Repository Initialization** - Create GitHub repos from local folders (coming soon)

## Commands

### `autopilot connect`

Connect your GitHub account by providing a Personal Access Token (PAT).

```bash
autopilot connect
```

**What it does:**

-   Prompts for your GitHub Personal Access Token
-   Validates the token with GitHub API
-   Securely stores credentials in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
-   Supports `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable as fallback
-   Only allows one connected account at a time

**Requirements:**

-   A GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
-   You can create one at: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens

### `autopilot user`

Check which GitHub account is currently connected.

```bash
autopilot user
```

**What it does:**

-   Displays your connected GitHub username
-   Shows additional profile information (name, email if available)
-   Validates that your token is still valid

### `autopilot logout`

Disconnect your GitHub account and remove stored credentials.

```bash
autopilot logout
```

**What it does:**

-   Removes your stored GitHub token from the system keychain
-   Disconnects your current session
-   Requires running `autopilot connect` again to reconnect

**Use cases:**

-   Switching to a different GitHub account
-   Revoking access when done with a project
-   Security best practice when sharing a machine

### `autopilot --help`

Display help information for all available commands.

```bash
autopilot --help
```

### `autopilot --version`

Show the current version of Autopilot.

```bash
autopilot --version
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install Autopilot**

    ```bash
    npm install -g @rudrapatel50/autopilot
    ```

2. **Connect your GitHub account**

    ```bash
    autopilot connect
    ```

3. **Verify your connection**

    ```bash
    autopilot user
    ```

4. **When you're done, logout**
    ```bash
    autopilot logout
    ```

## How It Works

### Secure Credential Storage

Autopilot uses `@napi-rs/keyring` to securely store your GitHub token in your operating system's native credential manager:

-   **macOS**: Keychain
-   **Windows**: Credential Manager
-   **Linux**: Secret Service API (libsecret)

Your token is never stored in plain text files, ensuring your credentials remain secure.

### Token Validation

When you connect, Autopilot validates your token by making a request to GitHub's API (`GET /user`). This ensures:

-   The token is valid and active
-   You have the necessary permissions
-   We can retrieve your GitHub username for display

### AI-Powered Commit Messages (Coming Soon)

Autopilot will integrate AI to automatically generate meaningful commit messages based on your code changes. The AI will:

-   Analyze file diffs to understand what changed
-   Generate descriptive, conventional commit messages
-   Follow best practices for commit message formatting
-   Support customization for different commit message styles

This feature will make `autopilot push` and `autopilot watch` even more hands-off by eliminating the need to write commit messages manually.
